Let's walk through a high level overview of how we integrate Git Flow with DABs. Git Flow is a branching model that involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches. This workflow streamlines the process of developing, testing, and deploying Databricks projects by leveraging Git flow's structured branching model with GitHub actions for automation. The process begins on the very far left of the screen here where the developer has created a feature branch from the dev branch. This is where the individual features or bug fixes are developed in isolation. Developers can deploy code directly to the dev Databricks workspace using the Databricks CLI. Once the development on a feature branch is complete, a pull request is open. After the code is peer reviewed, it is merged into the dev branch. After merging into Dev, the next step involves triggering the GitHub actions workflow for drafting a release. This deploys the changes to the QA environment using DABs, runs tests, code coverage checks and security scans, and finally creates the version release branch. It also creates a PR for the release branch to be merged into Main. After the release PR is closed, it triggers another GitHub actions workflow that deploys the bundle to prod. Creates a release tag and eventually a PR for Main branch is merged into Dev. Finally, if a critical issue arises in production, we handle it with a hot fix branch, which is branched from Main and then merged back into both Main and Dev after the fix is applied. This ensures that our production environment remains stable while allowing ongoing development to continue. Let second a moment to review Git on Databricks. Git is a free and open-source software framework designed to track changes in source code during software development. Some common Git tools and Git based services are listed here such as Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and AWS. When integrating third party tools into your workflows, make sure that it makes sense for your organization's needs.
